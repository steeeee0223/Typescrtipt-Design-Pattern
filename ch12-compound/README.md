# Compound Pattern

### Duck Simulator

-   Combining multiple patterns:
    -   `Adapter`: Transfer _Goose_ to _Duck_
    -   `Decorator`: Count number of quacks
    -   `Abstract Factory`: Construct ducks

    -   `Observer`: Handle duck observer _Quackologist_
    -   `Template`: (Added by ME!) Refactor _Quackable_ to a template which implements _Observer_
